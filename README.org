Collection of useful python scripts for the CARLA simulator.
* TODOs
** to synchronize all sensors and to furthermore be able to simulate at any wanted framerates guide the implementation according to 'examples/synchronous_mode.py'
*** it does run locally on server but not from remote
*** TODO bring 'sensors_at_vehicle_sync.py' to run remotely
**** TODO try: move code for spawning actors into 'CarlaSyncMode' context, i.e. after lines 'with CarlaSyncMode(...'
***** maybe the asynchronizity is comming from the fact that the sensors are spawned not within synchronous mode and therefore start capturing at different times
**** TODO try: test old implementation of 'synchronous_mode.py' (version 0.9.5)
***** if it will run remotely aswell as locally than try upwards through git commits till the version that does not run anymore and figure out the buggy line
***** if it will not run remotely then the problem maybe relates closer to the subsystem and should no longer be investigated -> maybe then ask in forum ?
** DONE add stereo camera support, i.e. add additional camera sensor right of current one

** DONE add depth camera support placed at same position as left RGB camera
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 11:49]
** DONE add semantic segmantation camera support placed at same position as left RGB camera
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 11:49]
** TODO record test sequences and test on ORB-SLAM2 (additionally on libVISO2 or my own implementation)
** TODO extend implementation: let an arbitrary number of vehicles spawn at random places, all attached with sensors and driving around on random routes. After some (ranmdom?) time despawn vehicles individually.
*** NOTE possible in synchronous mode since each client would tell server to proceed asynchronously
**** could be possible if we setup a server for each client while each server listens on different ports
*** would be very fast way of recording lots of sequences
