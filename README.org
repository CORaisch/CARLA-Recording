Collection of useful python scripts for the CARLA simulator.
* TODOs
** to synchronize all sensors and to furthermore be able to simulate at any wanted framerates guide the implementation according to 'examples/synchronous_mode.py'
*** TODO bring 'sensors_at_vehicle_sync.py' to run
*** it does run locally on server but not from remote
** TODO add stereo camera support, i.e. add additional camera sensor right of current one
*** so far it seems that stereo frames can only be synchronized by timestamps
**** TODO test how well the timestamps can be used for synchronization
** TODO add depth camera support placed at same position as left RGB camera
** TODO add semantic segmantation camera support placed at same position as left RGB camera
** TODO record test sequences and test on ORB-SLAM2 (additionally on libVISO2 or my own implementation)
** TODO extend implementation: let an arbitrary number of vehicles spawn at random places, all attached with sensors and driving around on random routes. After some (ranmdom?) time despawn vehicles individually.
*** very fast way of recording lots of sequences
*** only useful if recordings of dynamic scenes (i.e. with moving objects in) are wanted
** TODO play around with simulation time by setting '-benchmark' and '-fps' at the server
