Collection of useful python scripts for the CARLA simulator.
* TODOs
** DONE to synchronize all sensors and to furthermore be able to simulate at any wanted framerates guide the implementation according to 'examples/synchronous_mode.py'
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 13:16]
** TODO sensors_at_vehicle_sync.py does run when client and server are invoked on different machines
*** TODO try: move code for spawning actors into 'CarlaSyncMode' context, i.e. after lines 'with CarlaSyncMode(...'
**** maybe the asynchronizity is comming from the fact that the sensors are spawned not within synchronous mode and therefore start capturing at different times
*** TODO try: test old implementation of 'synchronous_mode.py' (version 0.9.5)
**** if it will run remotely aswell as locally than try upwards through git commits till the version that does not run anymore and figure out the buggy line
**** if it will not run remotely then the problem maybe relates closer to the subsystem and should no longer be investigated -> maybe then ask in forum ?
** DONE add stereo camera support, i.e. add additional camera sensor right of current one
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 11:49]
** DONE add depth camera support placed at same position as left RGB camera
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 11:49]
** DONE add semantic segmantation camera support placed at same position as left RGB camera
   CLOSED: [2019-07-29 Mon 11:49]
** TODO add random weather selection at start
** TODO add support for dynamic scenes by adding vehicles and pedestrians to the world
** TODO add command line parser for parameters specifying..
*** .. which sensors should be used
*** .. sensor parameters
*** .. if world should be static or dynamic
*** .. where the data should be saved
*** .. weather presets
*** use python argparse: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
** TODO save sensor measurements and GT poses to disk
*** use same data structure as KITTI
*** maybe transform GT coord system to KITTI as well ?
*** write data to buffer first and save to disk in simultanous thread (else runtime of simulation will be heavily affected)
** TODO visualize the GT poses with evo-kitti tool to check if the representation is sufficient
** TODO record test sequences and test on ORB-SLAM2 (additionally on libVISO2 or my own implementation)
